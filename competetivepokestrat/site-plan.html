      <h3>The purpose of this site</h3>
      <p>
        People will come to this site to learn how to enter online competitive Pokemon.  This will function primarily as an introduction to online competitive play, rather than an in-depth strategy guide.  This way, beginners can more easily enter the online competitive scene, without being overwhelmed by large amounts of information they don’t yet know how to parse.  They will also be made familiar with the terminology used in competitive play, as well as the tools they need to succeed in their very first online competitive battle.  In summary, the visitors of this site will be able to take their pokemon gameplay to the next level, learning and practicing common competitive skills, improving their teams, and becoming much more knowledgeable about this scene.

      <h3>How to Build an Effective Team</h3>
      <p>
       One thing people should know before entering online play is how to build a proper team.  This site will explain how to create a team that can cover a wide variety of opposing types, one that can handle many common strategies, and is also very effective at its chosen strategy.  The basics of type coverage, having dedicated switch-ins that can resist certain threatening attacking types, as well as how to avoid common pitfalls in team creation will be covered.  The type matchup chart will be explained as well, which will allow people to understand the importance of having a balanced range of pokemon elemental types on their team.  Item selection will also be touched upon, with common, and very useful items, being presented to help them step up their team’s effectiveness.  Items such as the choice items, the focus sash, the assault vest, and leftovers will be explained, as well as how to best utilize these items.  Finally, the basics of usage tiers will be explained, as well as how the usage tier of their pokemon will determine which teams they will be allowed to go up against in competitive play.  Whether the player wishes to use nothing but Legendary pokemon in the Ubers tier, use some of the less popular pokemon in the Never Used tier, or simply wants to play competitive pokemon’s most popular competitive tier, the Overused tier, they will be well informed on how to not only qualify for these tiers of play, but to thrive in these often hostile environments.

      <h3>Raising your Team</h3>
      <p>
        Another thing people will want to know is how to actually obtain and raise pokemon for their team.  Competitive pokemon are generally selectively bred for their stats, which requires some technical knowledge, which will be provided in this site.  The strats for selective breeding in the games, as well as obtaining pokemon to help with this, will be explained in detail on this site to help the reader more easily construct their dream team.  The basics of IVs, natures, and their impact on a pokemon’s statistics and performance will be explained, as well as how these can be passed on via breeding.  Hidden abilities and egg moves, as well as how to obtain these, will also be explained in depth, allowing the potential trainer to understand the customization choices they have for all sorts of different pokemon.  This page will also cover where to get certain important items, such as TMs to teach important moves, held items to use during battle, and enhancement items to make their pokemon even stronger.  Finally, the basics of training a pokemon to be used in battle will be covered, which will include an explanation on Effort Values, and how to optimize the Effort Values that your pokemon ends up with, as well as how to efficiently level up your pokemon.
