      <h3>The purpose of this site</h3>
      <p>
        People will come to this site to learn how to enter online competitive Pokemon.  This will function primarily as an introduction to online competitive play, rather than an in-depth strategy guide.  This way, beginners can more easily enter the online competitive scene, without being overwhelmed by large amounts of information they don’t yet know how to parse.

      </ul>
      <h3>How to Build an Effective Team</h3>
      <p>
        One thing people should know before entering online play is how to build a proper team.  This site will explain how to create a team that can cover a wide variety of opposing types, one that can handle many common strategies, and is also very effective at its chosen strategy.  The basics of type coverage, having dedicated switch-ins that can resist certain threatening attacking types, as well as how to avoid common pitfalls in team creation will be covered.  Item selection will also be touched upon, with common, and very useful items, being presented to help them step up their team’s effectiveness.  Finally, the basics of usage tiers will be explained, as well as how the usage tier of their pokemon will determine which teams they will be allowed to go up against in competitive play.

      <h3>Raising your Team</h3>
      <p>
        Another thing people will want to know is how to actually obtain and raise pokemon for their team.  Competitive pokemon are generally selectively bred for their stats, which requires some technical knowledge, which will be provided in this site.  The strats for selective breeding in the games, as well as obtaining pokemon to help with this, will be explained in detail on this site to help the reader more easily construct their dream team.  This page will also cover where to get certain important items, such as TMs to teach important moves, held items to use during battle, and enhancement items to make their pokemon even stronger.  Finally, the basics of training a pokemon to be used in battle will be covered, which will include an explanation on Effort Values, and how to optimize the Effort Values that your pokemon ends up with, as well as how to efficiently level up your pokemon.
